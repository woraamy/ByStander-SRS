\section{Stakeholder Analysis}
\label{section:stakeholder-analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{General Public (User)} \\
    Individuals who may face emergencies and need quick access to assistance. 
    They rely on the app to locate help and receive clear, step-by-step guidance during critical situations.
    \item \textbf{Caregivers, Family Members, and Parents} \\
    Those responsible for vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly, people with medical conditions, or 
    children who cannot assist themselves. They require tailored instructions to handle emergencies effectively.

    \item \textbf{Emergency Services (Indirect Stakeholders)} \\
    Police, hospitals, and first responders who receive emergency calls. 
    The app provides structured reports to help them assess situations quickly and respond efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Medical Professionals and Experts} \\
    Healthcare providers, paramedics, and first-aid trainers who contribute to emergency guidance. Their expertise ensures the information given to users is medically accurate and reliable.
    \item \textbf{Developers} \\
    The team responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the app. They ensure that emergency detection, AI-generated reports, and user interaction are efficient, accurate, and accessible.

\section{Use Case Diagram}
\label{section:use-case-diagram}
<TIP: Write a use case diagram for your project here. Refer to an
article “What is a use case diagram?” by Lucidchart for help./>

\section{Use Case Model}
\label{section:use-case-model}
A use case is a detailed description of how a system
interacts with an external entity (such as a user or another system) to
accomplish a specific goal. Use cases provide a high-level view of the
functionality of a system and help in capturing and documenting its
requirements from the perspective of end users.

<TIP: Write use cases for your project here. Make sure to use the
appropriate type of use case for each scenario (brief, casual, and fully-dressed
use case)./>

\section{User Interface Design}
\label{section:user-interface-design}
<TIP: Put the initial design of your application here. You can
showcase a detailed design of a specific page or a sitemap of your application.
See an example below./>
